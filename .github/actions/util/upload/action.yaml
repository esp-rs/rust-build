# In addition to uploading the file to the release
# * This also turns a tag into a release if one doesn't exist already
# * doesn't fail if the file is already uploaded to the release
# * Is a lot simpler than upload-release-asset
# * Seems to be more actively maintained
# * Doesn't require the use of octokit/request-action@v2.x / get latest release
